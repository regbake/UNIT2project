7:21pm; 9/10; friday

Yeah, it's just a friday night and it's funny to be getting back to things into
the real world. Fun times at GA and just doing that whole thing, the happy
hours are actually a pretty good time to chill out with people and also considering
I don't have that much else going on I am not in a position to be complaining
about anything and so it goes. Really, so it goes. I'm having a really good time
with things and I also feel like I'm learning a lot in general. I guess that I
also feel good about the testing aspect of things and feel like I am in a position
to be learning a lot of good stuff in that department.
Well, so let's see. How does the rest of all this stuff look? I have a lot of stuff
going on in life and it's also an interesting thing to be thinking about because,
so it goes in the regular life. I am in a position to where I need to get thinking
about the project and what it is going to accomplish and so many other things.
I guess, the goal that I want to fill in is how, how am I going to get all of this
shit working together. What sort of planning can I put into this shit that will really
help me out later on. The goal of this stuff is that, you can choose which documents
you want to upload and then you can upload them.
So, I guess for starters that's going to be a part of the project that will need
to get worked on first. You need to be able to upload a document on your computer
and import it into the app. Things that are close to this are... I don't know maybe
you can be copying and pasting things into the document but I think that's kind
of beside the point.
